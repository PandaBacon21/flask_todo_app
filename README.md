# Basic Flask Todo App


Guided with https://dev.to/nagatodev/getting-started-with-flask-1kn1

You will need to create a .env file in the root directory to store your SECRET_KEY and a .flaskenv to set FLASK_APP=base.py and your debug settings. 

This is a basic flask app and I (currently) am not really focusing on the front end appearance in order to focus on the backend structure. I have worked with Flask on other projects, also smaller, but I have kept those mostly in the same monolithic structure. The focus of this project was to focus on creating a more scalable backend (I know I don't have a front/backend structure to this and everything is done with Flask).
